A Minecraft Mod, inspired by some of my favourite mods:

- [Industrial Craft](https://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=Main_Page), which doesn't support MC 1.13+.
- [Tech Reborn](https://wiki.techreborn.ovh), which don't have some useful items compared with IC2, and, the wiki is LAME.
- [ComputerCraft](http://www.computercraft.info/), which doesn't support MC 1.13+ (though there are [some effort](https://github.com/Merith-TK/cc-restitched)),
  this mod doesn't have many fetures we want (eg. enchanting) and a little bit too eazy. Moreover, this mod do not intract with the first two mods, 
  eg. I really hope turtle can live on electricity instead of coal or lava.
- [OpenComputer](https://ocdoc.cil.li/), also doesn't support MC 1.13+, and in contrary to ComputerCraft, this mod is too hardcore. It also don't intract with the first two mods.

So we come up with this one, a full featured industrial mod for minecraft, which:
- Supports Minecraft 1.17+
- IC2 liked indrustual system
- A Computer-Robot system, which complexity is between CC and OC, and tightly integrated with other indrustual items.
