# Rubber Tree

1. Run client.
2. Create a new world (creative world).
3. Fly around to find a rubber tree.
4. Dig all the logs and check whether the leaves break automatically and drop rubber tree sapling.
   (You might be very unlucky that rubber tree sapling don't drop but in fact the mod works well, so you should replace this several times before report a bug).
5. Plant the sapling and wait it growing. (You can set randomTick speed to make it grow faster, but don't use bone meal, which force to judge the growing, we need to check the growing happens on random tick).
6. Repeat step 4 once with the new grown tree.
